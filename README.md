# Garden Paradise 🪴✨
Garden Paradise was made in a relational database project, over three weeks, during my exchange in South Kore! It is a plant search app for beginner plant owners, who want to expand their plant collection and need help narrowing down their choices.

## 🔍 Main Functions
- Quick search 
- Advanced search
- Login and sign up
- Favorites
  

## Languages, frameworks and packages
- Python and SQL
- Tkinter for GUI development
- Pillow (PIL) for opening and resizing plant images
  

## What did I learn?
- Be critical of your data, so you don't get unexpected results in queries
- Inspecting your data as much as possible before you jump into it is valuable and make you respond to data errors quicker
- Data cleaning is time consuming, but also the most important part of data science
- Get more acquainted with GUI components before using them, as they can turn into bigger issues later on
