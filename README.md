# Garden Paradise 🪴✨

In Spring 2024, I spent a semester in South Korea on exchange. Garden Paradise was a collaborative team project in my all-time favorite course — Relational Databases. It's a plant search tool for beginner plant owners looking to expand their collection and need help narrowing down "next plant" options. The intention is to let users expand their plant knowledge and dictionary, and save their searches for future reference. This project was developed using Python and SQL, with Tkinter for GUI. Our data comes from Queensland’s Government’s ‘Waterwise Plants’ dataset.

## 🔍 Main Functions

- Login and sign up
- Favorites
  

## Languages, frameworks and packages
- Python and SQL
- Tkinter for GUI development
- Pillow (PIL) for opening and resizing plant images
  

## What did I learn?
- Be critical of your data, so you don't get unexpected results in queries
- Inspecting your data as much as possible before you jump into it is valuable and make you respond to data errors quicker
- Data cleaning is time consuming, but also the most important part of data science
- Get more acquainted with GUI components before using them, as they can turn into bigger issues later on

Finally, I want to extend my gratitudes to my project partner, Joaquin, and professor Gaya for giving me such a valuable experience ❤️‍🔥
